The dataset we chose was obtained from https://data.scorenetwork.org/golf/pga_drive_putt.html it focuses on the performance statistics of golfers during the 2022 PGA season, specifically across 19 professional tournaments.
Each row of data gives the measures for one golfer in one tournament. The dataset covers 19 PGA tournaments from the 2022 season with 1387 cases in all. Each tournament consists of four rounds of golf. Some golfers are eliminated after the first two (or sometimes three) rounds. Only players who competed in all four rounds (i.e. those that made the “cut”) are included in this dataset.
